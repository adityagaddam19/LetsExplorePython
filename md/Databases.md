# Databases
----
Following are the API's which can be used to access any database
## DB-API
---
The Python Database API (DB-API) defines a standard interface for Python database access modules. Itâ€™s documented in PEP 249. Nearly all Python database modules such as sqlite3, psycopg and mysql-python conform to this interface.
### Example

```

## SQLAlchemy
---
SQLAlchemy is a commonly used database toolkit. Unlike many database libraries it not only provides an ORM layer but also a generalized API for writing database-agnostic code without SQL.
> $ pip install sqlalchemy

### Example


```python

```

## Records

Records is minimalist SQL library, designed for sending raw SQL queries to various databases. Data can be used programmatically, or exported to a number of useful data formats.

> $ pip install records

Also included is a command-line tool for exporting SQL data.


```python

```

## SQLObject
--------
SQLObject is yet another ORM. It supports a wide variety of databases: Common database systems MySQL, Postgres and SQLite and more exotic systems like SAP DB, SyBase and MSSQL.


```python

```
