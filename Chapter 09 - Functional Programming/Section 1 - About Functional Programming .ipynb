    "Everything seems fine. Band dictionary originals are protected from mutation when a key is associated with a new value. But there are two other potential mutations in the code above. In strip_punctuation_from_name(), the unpunctuated name is generated by calling replace() on the original name. In capitalize_names(), the capitalized name is generated by calling title() on the original name. If replace() and title() are not functional, strip_punctuation_from_name() and capitalize_names() are not functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, replace() and title() do not mutate the strings they operate on. This is because strings are immutable in Python. When, for example, replace() operates on a band name string, the original band name is copied and replace() is called on the copy. Phew.\n",

    "One. call() is a higher order function. A higher order function takes a function as an argument, or returns a function. Or, like call(), it does both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two. apply_fn() looks very similar to the three transformation functions. It takes a record (a band). It looks up the value at record[key]. It calls fn on that value. It assigns the result back to a copy of the record. It returns the copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three. call() does not do any actual work. apply_fn(), when called, will do the work. In the example of using pipeline_each() above, one instance of apply_fn() will set 'country' to 'Canada' on a passed band. Another instance will capitalize the name of a passed band.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four. When an apply_fn() instance is run, fn and key will not be in scope. They are neither arguments to apply_fn(), nor locals inside it. But they will still be accessible. When a function is defined, it saves references to the variables it closes over: those that were defined in a scope outside the function and that are used inside the function. When the function is run and its code references a variable, Python looks up the variable in the locals and in the arguments. If it doesn’t find it there, it looks in the saved references to closed over variables. This is where it will find fn and key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five. There is no mention of bands in the call() code. That is because call() could be used to generate pipeline functions for any program, regardless of topic. Functional programming is partly about building up a library of generic, reusable, composable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good job. Closures, higher order functions and variable scope all covered in the space of a few paragraphs. Have a nice glass of lemonade.\n",

    "1 An immutable piece of data is one that cannot be changed. Some languages, like Clojure, make all values immutable by default. Any “mutating” operations copy the value, change it and pass back the changed copy. This eliminates bugs that arise from a programmer’s incomplete model of the possible states their program may enter.\n",

    "3 Tail call optimisation is a programming language feature. Each time a function recurses, a new stack frame is created. A stack frame is used to store the arguments and local values for the current function invocation. If a function recurses a large number of times, it is possible for the interpreter or compiler to run out of memory. Languages with tail call optimisation reuse the same stack frame for their entire sequence of recursive calls. Languages like Python that do not have tail call optimisation generally limit the number of times a function may recurse to some number in the thousands. In the case of the race() function, there are only five time steps, so it is safe.\n",
